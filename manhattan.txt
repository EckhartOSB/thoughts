Visited the cloisters. They wouldn’t let me chant in the medieval chapel. No sacred space there — only the bones of dead monasteries.

I walked almost 16 miles in Manhattan today in the rain. There are almost no public restrooms in the upper west side and I was desperate. I popped into Sido Felafel on Columbus near 72nd and said “I’ll buy dinner here if you have a restroom.”  The young man smiled and led me back through the kitchen. “Careful of the oven” he said. The bathroom was tiny but oh so welcome. No other customers were in the restaurant and the other people working there were watching tv in the back. Super Bowl I think. I went back out to the front and ordered dolmas, hummus and tabouleh. It might not have been the best Arabic food I’ve ever eaten but at that moment it has manna from heaven, especially with the nice Arabic tea that he brought me. 
When I was finished, I paid the owner in cash with a nice tip. He asked me if I knew Arabic and I had to admit that mine isn’t very good at all. He asked me if I was Christian or Jewish, and when he found out I was Christian he started telling me about the Copts, because he is from Egypt. He’s Muslim but he admires the Copts. I tell him that I’m a monk and that Christian monasticism started in Egypt and that I too admire the Coptic Church. I bless him for his tolerant faith and especially for his hospitality. We shake hands and I go out the front door and start putting my raincoat on. He hurries out with an umbrella and tries to get me to take it, but I successfully refuse while thanking him again for his generosity. 
Walking down Columbus in the rain, I feel relieved, filled, and blessed. Who knew that angels could be Muslim?
