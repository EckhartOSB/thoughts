Making a shot without planning for the next one is like starting on a journey wearing only one shoe.

If you haven't thought about where the cue ball is going, it is going where it can hide from your next shot.

If you haven't thought about where the 8-ball is going, it is going into a pocket.

Dirty pool acquires short-term advantage in exchange for long-term loss.  Only use it when you have no good shot.

With ball in hand, free the captive.  Don't waste the opportunity on an easy shot.

Disadvantage isn't how many balls remain, but the obstacles to pocketing them.

The greatest obstacles aren't physical, they're emotional.

When emotions are removed from play, the 8-ball is just another shot.

If you must win, you won't.

It's not about controlling the balls as much as it is about controlling yourself.

Unconscious movement in your body will render all of your geometry useless.  Be conscious of your body, and relax.

Be consistent, and only then make small adjustments.

Pay close attention to where the cue meets the ball.  Practice striking dead center until it becomes second nature.  Then, and not until then, learn about backspin and topspin.  Finally, explore other kinds of spin.  Spin is too often unintentional in beginners, and affects their shots in ways that make them wonder how anyone ever controls the cue ball.

To consistently strike the ball where you intend, you must also pay close attention to the movement of the cue stick in your hands.  Practice a straight, level back to front motion -- no scooping or waving, especially when striking with force.

The farther any ball travels, the more likely it will do something you won't like.  This is especially true of the cue ball and the 8-ball.

More action, more scratches.

Use only the force you need.
