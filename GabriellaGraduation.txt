The most beautiful sound I ever heard was when you cried the day you were born.
Two months premature, the doctor worried that your lungs wouldn't be developed
enough.  But you came out screaming, and I wept tears of joy.  They wrapped you
in a blanket and handed you to me, and I said to you what I had often said to
you through your mother's belly: "Hang in there, little girl!" You quieted down
immediately, and looked up at me with those big, round eyes.  Then I gave you
to your mother, but soon they had to take you down to the ICU to run tests and
keep an eye on you.  I came to see you later, and called to you as you lay
face-down in the incubator, "Hey, little girl!"  Even though you only weighed 4
pounds, you did a push-up to see me.  It only took 16 days for you to be strong
enough to go home.

Now you're starting a new adventure, leaving the womb of high school to begin a
life on your own terms.  There will be challenges along the way, and maybe
sometimes you'll feel like crying.  That's OK and good for the soul.  Just hang
in there, little girl.  You're going to do just fine.
