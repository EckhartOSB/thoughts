There is a humility born of fear
That cringes before the powerful
That says, "Oh I couldn't possibly"
And avoids attention so that its defects will not be noticed

There is a humility born of confidence
That says, "I do not need to be honored
Because I know how to honor myself."

There is a humility born of love
That says "I willingly step aside
To give honor to the God in you."

But it doesn't even say that
Because that would be taking some honor to itself.
It only acts silently
Laying divinity aside
Taking on human flesh
Dwelling among us
