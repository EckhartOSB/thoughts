Tamar

Desire for her body
Drove Amnon to rape her
Then in disgust he spurned her
She tore her royal robe
With ashes on her head
She walked along
And cried

Desire for worldly order
Drove us to condemn him
With crown of thorns we mocked him
And sent him to the cross
Followed by his mother
Who walked along
And cried

Desire for wealth and power
Drove us to enslave them
We beat them to submission
Made them less than human
And toiling in our fields
They walked along
And cried

Desire for yet more land
Drove us to expel them
We herded them like cattle
With even less compassion
They perished on the way
As they walked along
And cried

Yet even this was not enough
The land we seized, we raped
The Earth with open wounds
And choking breath
And poisoned tears
Walks along
And cries

What is this evil in our hearts
That drives us first to grasp and then destroy?
Lord, purge us from our ravaging desires
Help us heal the hurt we cause
As with ashes on our heads
We walk along
And cry
