What does not escape my grasp
I pull in closer and closer
One thing after another
Acquiring, amassing
But at the same time growing smaller
Until I vanish in the black hole called death

But isn't what flows out from me
More me than the things I consume?
Why draw a line around that point
And call it me
When it is one drop in a much larger sea?
Ever expanding, wave upon wave
I am in all that is yet to be
And before Abraham was, I am
