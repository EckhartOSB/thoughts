I waited for the train, sitting on the bench and meditating with eyes open, staring down at the stones that make up the platform.  Suddenly the Spirit told me to look up.  As my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the sky above, a figure emerged, circling above me.  Probably a vulture, I thought.  But as my vision cleared, I could see the fan tail and bright white head.  An eagle!  It continued to circle above me, ascending without flapping a wing, higher and higher for about five minutes -- then it turned and disappeared in the clouds to the southwest.

Goodbye again, old friend.
