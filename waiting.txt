"Waiting for the Lord" sounds like deferring responsibility.
"Hiding in the shadow of your wings until this trouble has passed" sounds like an inability to face your problems.
But in practice this posture is about surrendering control over the outcome.
Even though its hope lies in the future, the shape of its fulfillment must be left to God.
This frees you from attachment to a specific future
And allows you to live in the present moment
Drawing strength to live today
And to trust for tomorrow
And the next day
And the next day
Step by step
Not growing faint.
