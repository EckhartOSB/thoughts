Oh, be gentle!  Don't break his body
More than it already has been broken!
I know that we can't harm him any more
But still, be gentle with those hands
Those hands, that healed so many
Now cold and useless, drained of blood
Where is their healing power now?
Down it has gone, down to Sheol.

Don't pull down, they won't come out that way.
The wood's too hard, you'll have to draw them straight
Toward your heart
Cursed nails!
Cruel cross!
Let him go!
You can no longer hold him in your grasp!
Yet you, vile torture, have sacred become
By lifting his body and pouring his blood

Ah, there it comes.  Don't let him fall!
Hold him close, from hands alone he'll slip!
Yes, we all will be unclean when we are done.
But what is that, when our whole nation
Led foremost by our elders and our priests
Have defiled ourselves with this unholy act?

Oh, let them take offense!
What do I care now?
They were wrong!
And so was I, to stay silent for so long.

Gently, gently
Watch his head!
O blessed head
Still young and yet so wise
How brightly burned the fire in those eyes!

They say his father's name was Joseph
A Galilean, I never met him
How proud I would have been to be his father
But I'm not worthy of an honor such as that
No, he was more a father to me
His wisdom far beyond my years
Who then is old enough to be his father?
The Ancient of Days alone.

We'll take him to the new tomb in the garden
It's near, and Nicodemus said he'll meet us there
With myrrh and aloes for the shroud.

I made that tomb, hewn out of the rock
Thinking, at my age, to be the first to lie therein
But now he takes my place
And I will follow him
To await the resurrection of the just.
Among whom, it would come as no surprise
Were he to be the very first to rise
