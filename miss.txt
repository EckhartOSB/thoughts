I miss our strange talks
About everything and anything
When you and I were mere mortals!
But now you ride on clouds of glory
And I on crescent moon
Our sunlit stained-glass images
Staying in the lines

I miss the times I held you close
Releasing restful milky flow
Your tiny fingers grasped my thumb
I smiled into your sleepy eyes
That slowly sank in silent slumber
And wondered what newborn worlds
One day you would awaken
