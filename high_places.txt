We build our high places to worship you grandly
 But do we exalt you, O God, or ourselves?
 "Where are you going?" you quietly ask us
 "Looking for you" is our sheepish reply
 O bring us back down to the quiet low places
 And gently lead us beside the still waters

 from lectio divina on Ezekiel 20:29
