I know your need to throw away
baby and bathwater together.
You need to be rid of all the filth
and too much stubbornly clings
to tiny, grasping fingers
and inside mouth and ears.

It's been so many years
since I hurled the squealing infant
out of the tub
and heard it's thud --
then silence.

Day by day I watched it decay
until only its bones remained.
I was careful not to shed a tear
It's all for the best, I said.

I confess it was the screaming,
the late nights, and the feeding
that I detested more than the dirt.

It's a dark and dreary peace
that's bought at the cost of life
but if this is your destined path
then I suppose that you must walk it.

I don't know why I didn't let
the dogs drag off the bones.
Perhaps I half heard
some silent, winged word
that someday flesh and breath would return
and the child would live again.
