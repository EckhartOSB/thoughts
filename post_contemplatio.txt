O Lord, we thank you for your many gifts
The gift of music
The gift of poetry
The gift of sacred places
The gift of laughter
And the gift of tears

We thank you for the gift of silence

Help us, as we go out into our busy and distracted lives
To stop

To find that point of silence
That lies at the center of every moment
To return there
To dwell there
With You
Amen
