Deliver me, O God, from a scorched-earth spirituality that says, “No one can crush my spirit, for I will crush it first.”

Good Americans couldn’t hate so much if they weren’t blind to most of their hatred.

The narrow road of walking by vision and not by sight.

If you are God’s gift to the world, stop acting like a mail bomb.
