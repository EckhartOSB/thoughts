Waiting for a storm again
The tale of Noah comes to mind
How God Almighty nearly lost
His attachment to humankind

But as a struggling alcoholic
Hides a fifth beneath the seat
God so leaked his plan to Noah
Good intentions incomplete

Sometimes I wish he hadn't 
Mother Earth sometimes wishes so
Though she's somewhat codependent
Shielding us as her pains grow

Now she writhes and weeps
Shrieks and throws things
And wonders whether she'll survive
Our birthing
