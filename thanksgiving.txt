Now let us thank Thee, Lord, for all Thy worth
Thy mercies and Thine everlasting love
For all the wonders of this life on earth
And all Thou hast reserv'd for us above

For laughter, playful amity of friends
For solitude, serene and silent bliss
For water, as on lowly path it wends
Yet melts down mountains by its constant kiss

We thank Thee for the eagle soaring high
Who teacheth us to wait upon Thine aid
Majestic wing and keen, far-seeing eye
Rejoicing in Thy strength, and unafraid

We thank Thee for the sparrow flitting low
To leave all care with Thee she doth impart
She falleth not without that Thou dost know
For nothing is too small for Thy great Heart

We thank Thee for successes, hopes fulfill'd
Battles won, and family love restor'd
Let not through pride our cup of joy be spill'd
Remind us that the vict'ry's Thine, O Lord

We thank Thee also for our struggles long
When hope seems vain, and hardships march amass'd
For ere the earthquake, wind, and fire have gone
Thy still, small voice may find our ear at last

So from our sister's grief Thou mad'st a bridge
To reach an island, poor and wrack'd and blown
That sharing but small cost so might we feed
A multitude, and not with bread alone.

We thank Thee for the poor upon our street
May we defend them from oppressors cold
Provide a place to sleep and food to eat
And in their weary eyes Thy Face behold.

For opportunities to serve each other
Especially we thank Thee for this treasure
To help unburden a sister or a brother
Enricheth us in love beyond all measure

We thank Thee for Thy saints who rest in peace
And also those who left us in despair
Shalt Thou, Good Shepherd, stay Thy search at such
A wall as Death -- a wall Thou'st crush'd before?

For that great act of overcoming Death
Tearing top to bottom every veil
'Twixt us and Thee, may thanks be all our breath
And walls between us may our hands assail

We for Thy Church sincerest thanks profess
Companions in continual rebirth
Each member of our congregation bless
As we become Thy Body here on earth

For ministers and clergy set apart
We thank Thee and implore Thy thoughtful care
That loving words may echo Thine own Heart
And guide us in the priesthood we all share

For music's voice, now thank we all our God
Of all expression nearest to Thine own
Bless throats and hands that bear this gift abroad
That in their notes Thy Spirit may be known.

Nor shall I fail to mention poetry
Though music's lesser sister, she doth serve
And I would be remiss if not to thank Thee
For this poem, which I did not deserve

What need hast Thou, O God, of our thanksgiving?
Weakest praise for the Maker of all things!
We cannot add one candle to Thy glory
Seekest Thou aught else thanksgiving brings?

Indeed to re-create us is Thine aim
In the chaos of our souls, to call forth light
To make us in Thine Image once again
And with us walk the garden of delight

The gift of Thanksgiving is to see Thee face to face
For the heart that is grateful is a heart fill'd with grace
