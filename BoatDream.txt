Triple Dream

I boarded a ferry boat with several others.  The captain of the boat, a young man with a brown beard, herded us all to the left lane (we seemed to be in cars at the time), so that we would be closer to the center line of the boat, until we disembarked.  Then we were allowed to roam freely.  We were sailing to the north, and it was a clear day.  I was surprised at how short the journey was, and I was standing in the bow when we reached the other side.  I volunteered to tie us up, and made a clumsy knot of the ship's rope to an overhanging tree that wasn't very big or sturdy at all.  But everyone got out on foot and roamed about the rocky shore.  I was the last one out, and the loss of my weight caused the boat (which seemed to be considerably smaller now) to bob out of the water and hang by the branch of the tree.  I was afraid my knot wouldn't hold, but it did.  Then I turned to the captain to pay the fare -- for some reason I felt obliged to pay for everyone -- he wrote up the invoice with a pen using one of the rocks by the shore as a writing desk, and then announced, "One thousand dollars!"  I was a bit shocked by the amount, but then figured maybe ten people at $99 each...

I awoke, and wondered what this dream meant as I went to the bathroom.

My sister, Roanna, was worried about taking the journey northward.  I reassured her that our Uncle Robert David and his wife Carol were paying her fare.  This was his first wife, Carol, not his current Carol, and my sister and I were still children.  They would pay her way, but she would have to wear the green velvet dress that she wore in their wedding -- which she loved to wear anyway.  I silently resolved that I would go with her, even though I would probably have to pay my own way.

I awoke again.

I was on a huge boat, cruise-ship size, with lots of people all dressed up.  We were heading north through icy waters.  

I awoke a third time.
