Holy God, Who created the world and saw that it was good
Help me to see the holiness of all things
To give over everything as an offering to You
To receive all things from Your Hand
To cherish every moment as a gift
To set down every footstep as a sacrament
To hear Your voice in every whisper of the wind
To witness Your glory in sunlit heavens and greasy pavement
To see the light of Christ in every eye that meets mine
To fall in love all over again
With You and with all Your children
Amen.
