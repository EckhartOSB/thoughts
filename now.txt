Why do you pray? asked the Spirit, with quiet suddenness
Why do I pray? I repeated, and waited
Waded up the stream of intention

The answer came to me as naturally
As finding a round stone in a clear, sunlit creek
I picked it up and held it in my hand
I pray because You called me to it
And gave it to me as a gift.

Then light filled my senses
And words came unbidden
Bless You, Creator God
Who makes all things
From nothing
Every moment.

The stone falls from my grasp
The chime sounds
Past and future
Ripple
Echo
From this
Holy
Now
