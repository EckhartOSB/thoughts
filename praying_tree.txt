Old oak of many years and limbs
You never tire of holding out your hands
In rooted dance and silent hymns

No other duty calls you
No other thoughts abate you
From communion with the One
Who still continues to create you

Her leaves a breeze moved softly through
She seemed to whisper, "Why not you?"
